# Eye-Follower

This repository contains CSS code for creating a mouse cursor follower using HTML, CSS and JS. The eyes feature an elliptical shape, and a pupil that moves upon hovering.

### CSS Explanation

- The `.eye` class defines the style for the eyes, including size, border, and border-radius for the elliptical shape.
- `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements are used to create eyelashes.
- The `.ball` class styles the pupil and provides a hover effect to simulate eye movement.

### Responsive Design

The CSS code includes media queries for responsiveness on smaller screens. Adjustments are made to the eye and pupil sizes for optimal viewing on different devices.
